# Iggor Alves

Backend-focused Software Engineer (Java, Clojure, Kotlin) with 10+ years of experience. I design, build, and operate resilient services—end‑to‑end—from product discovery to production reliability.

- Currently building fintech systems at [QuintoAndar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br), focusing on payments, credit, and risk.
- Comfortable across the stack: from backend and data pipelines to cloud, CI/CD, and a bit of frontend when it helps the mission.
- Pragmatic by default: prefer clear designs, simple APIs, strong tests, and excellent observability.

---

### What I do

- Design and implement distributed systems and event-driven architectures
- Model domains with DDD and ship evolvable APIs
- Improve performance (profiling, JVM tuning, caching, indexing) and reliability (SLOs, incident response)
- Build robust pipelines and developer tooling (CI/CD, testcontainers, ephemeral envs)
- Apply solid security practices for fintech workloads

### Principles I work by

- Keep systems observable: metrics, traces, logs first-class
- Prefer boring tech for critical paths; innovate where it pays off
- Small, frequent releases with strong tests > big-bang launches
- Clear ownership, helpful runbooks, and humane on-call
- Code is for people first—clarity beats cleverness

---

### Recent focus

- High-throughput services for payments and credit decisioning
- Event-driven workflows with strong idempotency and exactly-once semantics where it matters
- Data quality, schema evolution, and safe migrations
- Platform foundations: CI speed, test reliability, and DX

---

### Selected topics I like to talk about

- JVM performance, GC, and profiling in production
- Event orchestration vs. choreography, Sagas, and outbox patterns
- API design (REST/HTTP), backward compatibility, and versioning
- Observability with SLOs and practical incident analysis
- Clojure in production: simplicity, REPL-driven dev, and interop
